# laxhjalp

Läxhjälp is a homework assignment. I created this so I can keep track of where I am, and go back if I mess up.
It's my first github project so I'm also trying to learn from it and use git properly! 

The assignment is for a course called "Webbutveckling 1". 
It's a fake website for a company and experiments with menu types, css styles etc.
